<h1>Uninstaller for Foomatic-RIP</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Foomatic-RIP uninstaller safely removes all of the Foomatic-RIP software. The Foomatic-RIP uninstaller does <b>not</b> remove <b>Ghostscript</b>, which may be in use by other drivers on your system. If you wish to remove <b>Ghostscript</b> you must use the separate uninstaller for that software.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Using the uninstaller</h2>
<p>To begin the uninstall process simply click <b>Continue</b> below; on the following screen select the appropriate volume and click <b>Continue</b>; on the final screen click the <b>Upgrade</b> button.</p><p> <em>Please note</em> that although the button says <b>Upgrade</b> you are actually removing the software. If the final button says <b>Install</b>, rather than <b>Upgrade</b>, then running the uninstaller will do nothing to your system.</p><p style="font-size:125%;">
Mac OS X 10.5.x (Leopard) and Mac OS X 10.6.x (Snow Leopard) users will always see an <b>Install</b> button.  The uninstaller will still perform properly.
